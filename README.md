# modpack.js

This is a proof of concept project that aims to take some useful parts from libraries and pack them in a single modular library.
It is intended to be used in a browser after being processed by a tool like [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

At the time of writing, only some functions coming from [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) has been copied.
